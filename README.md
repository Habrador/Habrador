## Hi!

Welcome to the **top 6000 most starred GitHub account in the world** ([Source](https://gitstar-ranking.com/Habrador)) and the **#114 most followed account in Sweden** ([Source](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/followers/sweden.md))!

The one who's running the show is me, Erik Nordeus. I'm an imagineer (creative engineer) who's interested in the intersection between art and engineering. I design mostly Unity and Blender projects. After finishing my mandatory military service, defending King and country, I got a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden, where I also live. The rest is history... 

My goal with my open source projects is that the code should by as easy as possible for you to understand, so I love to comment it and make it as simple as possible! I once wrote [a book about a guy called Elon Musk](https://www.habrador.com/p/elonmuskbook/) (written in 2013 before he became more controversial), and I read somewhere that authors are the best at commenting code because they know how to explain complicated topics in a simple way. Thus I hope I will fulfill my promises!

Another goal is to become the top 1000 most starred GitHub account in the world. That would today require a total of 16000 stars. Wish me luck on that one!

## FAQ

* **Are you related to the company [Nordeus](https://nordeus.com/)?** No, my surname Nordeus is a family name. If you googled Nordeus before the Nordeus company was founded you could only find people with that name in Sweden, so I'm not sure how they got the name. But they follow me on Twitter! Kinda funny that both of us are into Unity.
