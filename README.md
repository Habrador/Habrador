## Hi!

I'm Erik Nordeus. I'm an imagineer (creative engineer) who's designing mostly Unity and Blender projects. After finishing my mandatory military service, defending King and country, I got a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden, where I also live. The rest is history... 

My goal with my open source projects is that the code should by as easy as possible for you to understand, so I love to comment it! I once wrote [a book about a guy called Elon Musk](https://www.habrador.com/p/elonmuskbook/), and I read somewhere that authors are the best at commenting code because they know how to explain complicated topics in a simple way. Thus I hope I will fulfill my promises!

## FAQ

* **Are you related to the company [Nordeus](https://nordeus.com/)?** No, my surname Nordeus is a family name. If you googled Nordeus before the Nordeus company was founded you could only find people with that name in Sweden, so I'm not sure how they got the name. But they follow me on Twitter! Kinda funny that both of us are into Unity.


## THANK YOU...
