## FAQ

* **Are you related to the company Nordeus?** No, my surname Nordeus is a family name. If you googled Nordeus before the Nordeus company was founded you could only find people with that name in Sweden, so I'm not sure how they got the name. But they follow me on Twitter! Kinda funny that both of us are into Unity.


## Final note

**THANK YOU** everyone who has used and contributed to my open source projects!
